    "In what follows, we explain how to implement a GAN in Keras. Our specific implementation will be a deep convolutional GAN, or DCGAN: a GAN where the generator and discriminator are deep convnets. In particular, it uses a Conv2DTranspose layer for image upsampling in the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train our GAN on images from CIFAR10, a dataset of 50,000 32x32 RGB images belong to 10 classes (5,000 images per class). We will only use images belonging to the class \"frog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, our GAN looks like this:\n",
    "- A `generator`  network maps vectors of shape `(latent_dim,)` to images of shape (32,32,3);\n",
    "- A `discriminator` network maps images of shape (32, 32, 3) to a binary score estimating the probability that the image is real;\n",
    "- A `gan` network chains the generator and the discriminator together;\n",
    "- We train the discriminator using examples of real and fake images along with \"real\"/\"fake\" labels, as we would train any regular image classification model;\n",
    "- To train the generator, we use the gradients of the generator's weights with regard to the loss of the `gan` model. This means that, at every step, we move the weights of the generator in a direction that will make the discriminator more likely to classify as \"real\" the images decoded by the generator. I.e. we train the generator to fool the discriminator."

    "Finally, we setup the GAN, which chains the generator and the discriminator. This is the model that, when trained, will move the generator in a direction that improves its ability to fool the discriminator. This model turns latent space points into a classification decision, \"fake\" or \"real\", and it is meant to be trained with labels that are always \"these are real images\". So training gan will updates the weights of `generator` in a way that makes `discriminator` more likely to predict \"real\" when looking at fake images. Very importantly, we set the discriminator to be frozen during training (non-trainable): its weights will not be updated when training `gan`. If the discriminator weights could be updated during this process, then we would be training the discriminator to always predict \"real\", which is not what we want!"
